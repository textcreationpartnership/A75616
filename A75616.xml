         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Now theſe <hi>Sermons</hi> of his he had drawn up (ſo far as to the <hi>preaching</hi> of them) into a complete <hi>Body of Divinity</hi> in <hi>thirty</hi> diſtinct <hi>Aphoriſmes</hi> with their reſpective <hi>Exercitations;</hi> being alſo the <hi>ſum,</hi> and extract of moſt of his former labours in the whole courſe of his miniſtery; which He had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended (if God had permitted) to have fitted, and prepared for the preſs.

            <pb facs="tcp:119239:5"/>
            <p>It is called <hi>A Chain of Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> for ſundry reaſons likewiſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, From the <hi>Connexion,</hi> which they have one with another. For like as in a <hi>chain</hi> there are divers <hi>links</hi> joyned together, and theſe in a mutual <hi>dependance</hi> &amp; concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy and ſubordination; Even ſo is it likewiſe with the <hi>Doctrines and Principles</hi> of Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. <hi>They</hi> are <hi>connexed,</hi> and knit ſo together, as that there cannot be a denial of <hi>one</hi> of them: but <hi>more</hi> will conſequently fall with it. Look as in things neceſſary to <hi>be done,</hi> there is a dependance and connexion of <hi>Commands,</hi> ſo that he, who breaketh <hi>one</hi> Law is interpreted to break <hi>all the reſt,</hi> &amp; to be guilty of an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal</hi> tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſsion;
<pb facs="tcp:119239:5"/> becauſe he ſins againſt that <hi>General Authority,</hi> whereby all the reſt were given; ſo alſo in things neceſſary to be <hi>beleeved;</hi> he that denieth <hi>One</hi> Article of faith which is offered to him by God to be received, <hi>denieth the Faith</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 8.</note> 
               <hi>it ſelf</hi> in the <hi>latitude</hi> of it: as ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againſt the <hi>General Veraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of him that propounds it, and weakening all <hi>other Truths,</hi> which are dependent upon it. Though perhaps in ſo doing, he may not always <hi>actually intend</hi> it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, A <hi>Chain</hi> alſo for that ſpecial <hi>Concord</hi> and Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which it breedeth (and <hi>ought</hi> to breed) in thoſe that <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs</hi> it, notwithſtanding all colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral and circumſtantial diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences

From thence it cometh to paſs, that there is ſo much <hi>diſunion</hi> in <hi>Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> becauſe there is ſo much <hi>diſtraction</hi> in <hi>opinion.</hi> Whereas the <note place="margin">Acts 4. 32.</note> 
               <hi>Primitive Beleevers,</hi> whiles they were all of <hi>one Faith,</hi> they were anſwerably all of <hi>one heart</hi> and <hi>of one ſoul;</hi> and ſo <hi>preſerving the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>

            <p>Thirdly, <hi>A Chain</hi> alſo for the <hi>worth</hi> and dignity of it, Prov. 1. 9. <hi>They ſhall be an ornament of Grace unto thine head, and Chains a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thy neck.</hi> Perſons of <hi>Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> and Authority they are wont to wear their golden <hi>Chains</hi> wherewith they are ſet out and <note place="margin">Gen. 41. 42.

The Preacher reſolves it in the negative, by reaſon of that univerſal <hi>vanity,</hi> which overſpreads the whole creation. Therefore it is, that <hi>the eye</hi>

                  <p>§. 3. <hi>Coheleth,</hi> which is the ſtyle he gives himſelf in that Book, comes from a root, that ſignifies to <hi>collect</hi> and <hi>gather,</hi> and, though it be of a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minine termination, is, for want of a common gender in the Hebrew
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:119239:20"/> tongue, (as other words of the like form) capable enough of a maſculine conſtruction. To him it may be thought agreeable upon four different notions, each whereof contributeth much validity to what he teſtifies. Firſt as a <hi>Preacher,</hi> who having <hi>gathered</hi> ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry arguments to convince the ſons of men of the inſufficiency of all things below God himſelf to render them happy, in that Diſcourſe ſpeaks as to a <hi>Congregation;</hi> whereas in the <hi>Proverbs</hi> he had ſpoken as to one man, frequently uſing this compellation, <hi>My ſon.</hi> So <hi>Hierom,</hi> and <hi>Cajetan.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly as <hi>a writer,</hi> who had <hi>collected</hi> into a <hi>Synopſis</hi> all the opinions of thoſe, who had been taken for wiſe men by their ſeverall followers concerning happineſs, confuting ſuch as vvere erroneous.

                  <p>§. 4. In his Teſtimony, <hi>Vanity of vanities, vanity of vanities all is vanity,</hi> the Aſſertion is repeated, as in <hi>Pharaohs</hi> dream, to ſhew its <hi>certaintie;</hi> and the term of vanity doubled, partly to manifeſt the <hi>tranſcendency</hi> thereof, as the moſt holy place was ſtyled <hi>The Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Holies,</hi> and the moſt eminent Canticle <hi>The Song of Songs:</hi> and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to note the <hi>multiplicity,</hi> as Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture calleth that the <hi>Heaven of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,</hi> which, being higheſt, contains

                  <p>Firſt ſo <hi>unprofitable,</hi> as to be <hi>hurtfull</hi> withall. Upon this the Preacher ſeems to have had a ſpeciall eye, becauſe after <hi>All is vanity,</hi> he ſubjoyns imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately <hi>What profit hath a man of all his</hi>

Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary beleevers (whoſe hearts are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, though not ſavingly wrought upon) ſeem to have bought, yet do not eat, for want of that ſpirit of faith, which ingrafts men into Chriſt, and makes them as truly one with him as the body is with the meat it feeds up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Want we encouragements to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of this <hi>invitation?</hi> The place it ſelf preſents us with three.</p>
                  <p>§. 3. One from the fulneſs of that ſatisfaction which is here tendered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the metaphors of <hi>water, wine, milk,</hi> and <hi>bread:</hi> the laſt whereof is implied partly in thoſe terms of oppoſition, <hi>For that which is not bread,</hi> as if he had
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:119239:40"/> ſaid, ye might have had that of me which is bread indeed, partly in the verb <hi>Eat,</hi> which cannot ſo properly be applied to any commodity here mentioned, <hi>water, wine,</hi> and <hi>milk</hi> being liquids, as to <hi>bread.</hi> Now there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in Chriſt to anſwer each of theſe. <hi>His fleſh</hi> is bread, <hi>his bloud</hi> is wine, <hi>his</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">John 6. 51. Matth. 26. 28, 29. John 7. 38, 39. 1 Pet. 2. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>Spirit</hi> is waters, <hi>his doctrine</hi> is milk. But becauſe I conceive the Holy Ghoſt in this place doth not ſo much intend a parallel of theſe, as a declaration of that ſufficiency which is to be found in Chriſt and his benefits for ſaving to the utmoſt of all thoſe that ſhall come unto God by him; I ſhall onely pitch upon that conſideration, and by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding unto this a like place in the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> briefly demonſtrate from them both how all-ſufficient a Saviour he is. This in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> holds forth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what proper to every ſort of true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers. <hi>Milk</hi> for babes, <hi>water</hi> for ſuch <note place="margin">Vinum Lac ſenum.</note> as are young and hot, <hi>wine</hi> for the aged, <hi>bread</hi> for all. The other is that of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:119239:41"/> Chriſt to the Angel of the Church of <hi>Laodicea, I counſel thee to buy of me gold</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 3. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>tried in the fire that thou maiſt be rich, and white raiment that thou maiſt be clothed and that the ſhame of thy nakedneſs do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, and anoint thine eyes with eye-ſalve that thou maiſt ſee,</hi> where he commends his gold for ſuch as is tried in the fire, his raiment for ſuch as will take away ſhame, and his eye-ſalve for a ſpecial vertue to make the blinde ſee. Take them together, and there is in them enough to ſupply our principal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, viz. <hi>unbelief in the heart</hi> for which there is here <hi>gold tried in the fire,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may probably underſtand the grace of faith, concerning which we read in Peter, <hi>That the tryal of your faith,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>being much more pretious then of gold that periſheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praiſe. And unholineſs in the life,</hi> for which there is the white rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if by it we underſtand inherent righteouſneſs, according to that in the Apocalypſe, <hi>To her was granted that ſhe</hi>

                     <hi>ſhould be arraied in fine linen, clean and white, for the fine linen is the righteouſneſs of the ſaints.</hi> Laſtly <hi>Ignorance in the minde,</hi> for which there is his Eye-ſalve to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move it, according to the Apoſtles prayer for his <hi>Epheſians,</hi> that God would give them <hi>the ſpirit of wiſdome</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Epheſ. 1. 17, 18.</note> 
                     <hi>and revelation, the eyes of their understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing being enlightned</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>§. 4. A ſecond encouragement is from the univerſality of this offer. <hi>Ho every one that thirſteth come;</hi> ſo he do but thirſt he ſhall be welcome, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy ſoever he may be in other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects. <note place="margin">Dabit deſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranti gratiam, qui dat gratiam deſiderii.</note> He will give grace to the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, who enables them to thirſt after grace. Chriſt is far from turning ſuch perſons away; yea but for ſuch he would have no <hi>cuſtomers</hi> in the world; his <hi>commodities</hi> muſt lie by him <hi>dead</hi> for want of <hi>vent;</hi> ſeeing others will not <hi>take them off,</hi> but leave them ſtill upon his hand, as things in which they ſee no need, have no eſteem of. This let all men know for certain, that ſuch as
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:119239:42"/> thirſt ſo as to come, come ſo as to buy, buy ſo as to eat, will never have cauſe to repent of their bargain. I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where read of a great Commander, who being extremely tormented with thirſt, ſold himſelf and his Army into enemies hands for a draught of cold water; which when he had drunk he repented and ſaid. <hi>Oh quantum ob quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillum! How very little is that for which I have parted with ſo very much!</hi> Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers may take up the like words, but in a far different ſenſe: O how much grace, how much happineſs have I got for a little thirſting, a little truſting in Jeſus Chriſt!</p>
                  <p>§. 5. A third from the freeneſs of communication, amply declared in this clauſe, <hi>Come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.</hi> In the place hitherto inſiſted upon, the word <hi>money</hi> occurs thrice, twice in the firſt verſe and once in the ſecond, but not in the ſame ſignification. In the firſt it is clearly interpreted by <hi>price</hi> and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:119239:42"/> ſignifies <hi>merit;</hi> They are ſaid to have no money, who being conſcious to themſelves of their having nothing of their own to anſwer divine juſtice with, to fetch them in pardon, peace and righteouſneſs, wholly diſclaim all ſelf-ſufficiency, and come unto Chriſt as to one that expects not to <hi>receive</hi> but to be <hi>received;</hi> looks for little or nothing from us but that we be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in our ſelves, deſirous to have all from him, and to partake of his fulneſs grace for grace. In the ſecond it is expounded by labour, and denotes induſtry. Men are ſaid to ſpend mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for that, which they lay out their pains about. <hi>Money anſwers all,</hi> ſaith the Preacher: The Heathens have a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb <note place="margin">Eccles 10. 19. <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> which aſcribes as much to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. We ſay not with them, that God ſells his benefits to us for our pains; but this we acknowledge, he giveth them ſo as to require our induſtry about them. Yet is not this any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to the freeneſs of his grace, or
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:119239:43"/> any contradiction to that clauſe <hi>Buy without money and without price,</hi> becauſe our labour can no way merit his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings. As when a Schoolmaſter teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a boy <hi>gratis,</hi> the youth cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly attain to learning unleſs he be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious, and take pains at his book; but it doth not therefore ceaſe to be free on the teachers part, becauſe the learners pains are required. So it is here.</p>
                  <p>Yet ſome in all ages have been ſo vain as to dream of bringing their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney with them whenever they come; I mean that, which if not in it ſelf, yet in their opinion ſeems to deſerve what they come for. So the Phariſees of old, and the Papiſts of late. Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as <hi>Cornelius à lapide</hi> in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">Emptio eſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitio liberi arbitrii.</note> upon this very place, which maketh altogether for the contrary doctrine, countenanceth the popiſh te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents of free-will and merit of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity. <note place="margin">Emitur pretio non condigno, ſed congruo.</note> So Elephants, they ſay, are wont before they drink to bemud the

                  <p>§. 6. I proceed to the Expoſtulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on contained in the next words, <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do ye ſpend money for that which is not bread, and your labour for that which ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfieth not?</hi> Words applicable both to worldlings, and to ſuch beleevers as have not yet got clear of the world. Firſt to worldlings, who manifeſtly ſpend not their money onely, but their ſouls for that which is not bread. In the Lords prayer <hi>Bread</hi> is put for all neceſſaries, and uſed in the Lords ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to ſignifie the abſolute neceſsity of receiving Chriſt, by whom ſpiritual life is ſupported, as the natural life is by bread. Now the accommodations doted upon by men of the world, and often purchaſed with the loſs of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation are juſtly ſaid not to be bread, becauſe they are neither abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be had, nor able to ſupport ſuch as enjoy them. <hi>A mans life,</hi> ſaith
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:119239:44"/> our Saviour, <hi>conſiſteth not in the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the things which he poſſeſſeth.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Luke 12. 15.</note> Wealth indeed is an acceſſory good, but no neceſſary bleſsing. None are made really happy by it (though La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiniſts uſe the ſame word <hi>Beatus</hi> to ſignifie both rich and bleſſed) A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian may be happy without it; really happy, yea and really wealthy too, for he is abundantly rich that poſſeſſeth <note place="margin">Aſſatim dives eſt qui cum Chriſto pauper.</note> Chriſt in the midſt of poverty; and doth not make treaſure his God, as the ſervants of Mammon do, but God his treaſure.</p>
                  <p>§. 7. Furthermore, as the expreſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on there is, <hi>They spend their labour for that which ſatisfieth not.</hi> A late Jeſuite <note place="margin">Cornel. à la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pide Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. in Iſa. 55. 2.</note> tells us a ſtory of a feaſt made in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> by a certain Magician for Noble men, who whileſt they ſate at table with him received good content, and fared to their thinking very delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, but when they departed found themſelves hungry, as if they had eaten nothing at all: which indeed
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:119239:44"/> was their caſe; if the Jeſuites relation of the magicians art and fact may be credited. Such entertainment doth this preſent world afford its principal gueſts. They are not fed with ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubſtances, but with deluding ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows rather. <hi>Surely every man walketh in</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 39. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>a vain ſhew, ſurely they are diſquieted in vain. David</hi> ſpeaks it of ſuch as heap up riches: of whom alſo <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>The rich mans wealth is his ſtrong city, and</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 18. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>as an high wall in his own conceit.</hi> A ſtrong city in his conceit, but indeed a caſtle in the air. One that applies the ſcaling ladders of Scripture and reaſon to ſuch walls, may eaſily climb ſo high as to reach and pull down thoſe enſignes of vanity, which makes ſuch a flouriſh on the battlements thereof. Sooner ſhall men gather grapes of thorns and figs of thiſtles, then finde that a fountain of all good to any ſoul, the love where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Paul</hi> hath branded <hi>for the root of all</hi>

                     <hi>evil. It drowns in perdition;</hi> how can it then crown with happineſs? Oh that

                  <p>§. 8. Let authority be added to wealth, and great honours to great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues, yet will the product of both ſums be not ſoul-ſatisfaction and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs, but vanity and vexation of ſpirit.

Theſe two pipes being rightly laid from a Chriſtians ſoul to the fountain of living waters fetch in from thence a dayly ſupply of ſuch grace as will certainly end in a fulneſs of glory: whereas worldlings all the pipes of whoſe ſpirits are laid to ciſterns, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ciſterns that can hold no water, muſt needs continue empty ſtill; and

For to maintain (as ſome do) that a man may be ſaved in an ordinary courſe (I meddle not with extraordinary diſpenſations, but leave the ſecrets of God to himſelf) by any Religion whatſoever, provided he live according to the principles of it, is to turn the whole world into an <hi>Eden;</hi> and to finde a Tree of life in every garden, as well as in the paradiſe of God.</p>

Whereas in the Scriptures we meet with the names of <hi>Joſiah</hi> and <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and with their performances long before they had a being.

The onely way of preſerving ſouls from being drowned in eternal perdition, is having the grace and truth of Scripture ſo bound upon the heart as to be willing to part with money or any thing elſe, for the ſafety of them.

But the old Teſtament Scriptures received a ſtrong confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Chriſt by his appealing to them, arguing from them and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding of them. Yea ſo far were the Oracles of God from any diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by his coming, preaching and dying, that they received not a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation onely but a glorious au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gmentation, in that within a while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter there was added to them by his
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:119239:68"/> Secretaries the Evangeliſts and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles another Volume, I mean the books of the New Teſtament; upon the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing whereof there came out from God as it were a ſecond edition of his Oracles much enlarged.</p>
                  <p>§. 5. Fifthly and laſtly. In point of authoritie. Thoſe were from the father of lies, as hath been ſaid; but theſe from the Father of lights. Scripture is of divine authority: <hi>Holy men of God</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 21.</note> (ſaith <hi>Peter) ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> They wrote according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. <hi>All Scripture,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, was given</hi>

                     <hi>by inſpiration of God.</hi> It is not more true that they are oracles for their uſe, then that they have God for their authour. Many large volumes have been writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for to make good this aſſertion. It is a thing wherein the Spirit of God, who indited the Scripture, gives ſuch abundant ſatisfaction to the ſpirits of godly men, as to make other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, though not uſeleſs, yet to them of leſs neceſsity; He alone bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:119239:69"/> witneſs to the divinity of holy writ, and to the truth of his own teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, ſo putting a final iſſue to that controverſie. But becauſe there is need of other reaſons for the conviction of other men, I have produced certain ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments <note place="margin">T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>§. 6. From conſent thus. Writings of men differ exceedingly one from another, which made <hi>Seneca</hi> ſay, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Tunc inter Thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophos conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niet quando in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Horologia.</note> 
                     <hi>would then be all of one minde when all clocks were brought to ſtrike at one and the ſame time.</hi> Yea it is hard finding an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour that doth not differ from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf more or leſs, if he write much, and at various ſeaſons. But here is a moſt harmonious conſent. The word ſince written fully agrees with that which in former times was delivered to the Patriarchs, and tranſmitted by word of mouth. As the word <hi>God</hi> is the ſame
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:119239:69"/> to day, yeſterday and for ever, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though not incarnate till the fulneſs of time came, and then <hi>made fleſh:</hi> So <hi>the word of God,</hi> although till <hi>Moſes</hi> received a command to put it in writing, there wanted that kinde of incarnation, was for ſubſtance the ſame before and after. And as the <hi>written word</hi> agreed with the <hi>unwritten,</hi> ſo doth one part of that which is written harmonize with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. The two Teſtaments, Old and New, like the two breaſts of the ſame perſon give the ſame milk. As if one draw water out of a deep well with veſſels of different mettal, one of braſs, another of tin, a third of earth, the water may ſeem at firſt to be of a different colour; but when the veſſels are brought near to the eye, this diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of colours vaniſheth, and the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters taſted of have the ſame reliſh: So here, the different ſtyle of the hiſtorio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers from Prophets, of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets from Evangeliſts, of the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt from Apoſtles may make the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:119239:70"/> truths of Scripture ſeem of different complexions till one look narrowly into them and taſte them adviſedly, then will the identity both of colour and reliſh manifeſt it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>§. 7. From continuance thus. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the confuſions that have happened in the world, all the fires that have been kindled, the maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacres that have been executed, and the battels that have been fought againſt the true Chriſtian Religion, the ſtore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe thereof hath continued to this day, and theſe Oracles of God been preſerved in ſpite of hell. <hi>Solomons</hi> phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical treatiſes, which the world had no ſpleen againſt, but a liking of, are long ſince loſt; whereas his Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical writings are extant ſtill. When the earth clave aſunder to ſwallow up <hi>Ko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi> &amp; his company, there are that think ſome of <hi>his children</hi> were taken up by the hand of God into the air till the earth cloſed again, then ſet down with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having received any harm becauſe
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:119239:70"/> in the titles of ſundry Pſalms mention is made of <hi>the ſons</hi> of <hi>Korah,</hi> whom <note place="margin">Tirinus in Numer. 16. notâ ultimâ.</note> they ſuppoſe then preſerved to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate theſe whoſe ſervice the Lord had a purpoſe to uſe ſo long after. How often hath perſecution opened her mouth from age to age, and ſwallowed up millions both of men and books! Yet the bible hath been continued ſtill by the over-ruling hand of heaven, yea, which maketh it more remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, God hath ſo befooled the devil herein, as to preſerve his own Book many times by the hands of his and its enemies. It is too well known how ſmall friends the Jews are and have heretofore been to the truth contained in the old Teſtament, yet of them did the Lord make uſe to keep it, and they proved carefull feoffes in truſt for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king over the aſſurances of life to us Gentiles. Concerning one book of the New Teſtament, viz. the Apocalypſe, it is very obſervable that when the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority thereof was queſtioned of old,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:119239:71"/> the Church <hi>of Rome</hi> ſtruck in with her teſtimony, and was a ſpecial means to have it kept in the number of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical books; not without a ſpecial providence. God, who made <hi>Pharaohs</hi> daughter a ſecond mother to <hi>Moſes,</hi> whom he had appointed to bring de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction afterwards upon her fathers houſe and kingdome; did then make the Romiſh Church a drie nurſe to preſerve this Book (whoſe meaning ſhe knew not) that it might bring de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation upon her ſelf and her children afterwards. Well may we therefore conclude and ſay of the holy Bible, as <hi>Gamaliel</hi> once did of the Apoſtles <note place="margin">Acts 5. 38, 39.</note> preaching, Had this work been of men it would have come to nought longere this, but being it is of God, the devil and his complices have not been able to overthrow it.</p>
                  <p>§. 8. Learn we alſo from that hath been ſaid, to magnifie the grace of God, who in order to the promoting of our bleſſedneſs, hath brought us of

The firſt is <hi>via cauſalitatis,</hi> when from the creatures, whereof God is the ſupreme univerſal cauſe, reaſon begins to contemplate him as their efficient, becauſe they could not make themſelves. But hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto it onely diſcovereth <hi>Quod ſit,</hi> that there is a God, to whom all things ow their beings; not <hi>Quid ſit</hi> what he
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:119239:82"/> is. The ſecond is <hi>via remotionis,</hi> when it conſidereth the ſeveral imperfections of creatures, and removeth them all from God, as inconſiſtent with a Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Thus it conceiveth him immortal, impaſsible, impeccable, becauſe to die, ſuffer, ſin, are imperfections. But this onely ſheweth <hi>Quid non ſit,</hi> what he is not; ſhe is ſtill to ſeek for what he is. The third is <hi>via eminentiae,</hi> when rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon conſidereth the ſundry perfections, which are ſcattered here and there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong created beings, and aſcribes them all to God in an eminent and tranſcendent way. As when finding in Angels and men wiſdome, holineſs, and ſtrength, it conceiveth God to be moſt wiſe, moſt holy, and moſt ſtrong. Yet even this doth but ſhew <hi>Qualis ſit, non quis, what kinde</hi> of being God is, not <hi>who</hi> is he. Reaſon for that muſt be beholding to revelation. In which reſpects I cannot but applaud the wiſe anſwer of that Philoſopher, (<hi>Epictetus,</hi> as ſome report) who when his hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:119239:91"/> the vaſt ocean, though but one, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth divers names from the ſeverall ſhores it waſheth upon: ſo however Juſtice, Mercy, Power and the reſt, be ſeverall names ſuited to different ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations; yet God is but one <hi>ſimple Act</hi> under thoſe <hi>various denominations.</hi> Leſt we ſhould therefore apprehend them to be ſuch qualities as our virtues are, really diſtinguiſhable, yea and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable from our being (as appeared when the firſt man fell from his holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, yet continued a man ſtill) Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture doth ſometimes predicate them of God in the <hi>abſtract:</hi> as when Chriſt is ſtyled <hi>Wiſdome;</hi> when it is ſaid, <hi>God</hi>

                     <hi>is love,</hi> and <hi>the Spirit is truth.</hi> Men may be called loving, wiſe and true: God is love, wiſdome and truth it ſelf. The Apoſtle telleth us that if God ſwear, he doth it <hi>by himſelf and no other;</hi> yet we <note place="margin">Heb. 6. 13.</note> finde him in the Pſalm <hi>ſwearing by his</hi>

                     <hi>holineſs:</hi> whence it followeth that his holineſs is himſelf. Chriſt is uſually ſaid to ſit at the right hand of God; but
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:119239:91"/> in one place it is expreſt by ſitting <hi>on the right-hand of power:</hi> Therefore God <note place="margin">Mark 14. 62.</note> is Power, as well as Love. There is the ſame reaſon of all his attributes.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, Clearneſs of light. Since the Canon of Scripture was perfected, the things which the Holy Ghoſt diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth are no other for ſubſtance, but

And in that compendious prayer, which our Saviour taught us, there is a remarkable connexion of two petitions by a conjunctive parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, not to be found in any of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. <hi>Give us this day our dayly bread,</hi> And forgive us our treſpaſſes.

<pb n="228" facs="tcp:119239:131"/> make of himſelf in this place of <hi>Exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> and accordingly upon occaſion improveth it, by pleading with him for <hi>Iſraels</hi> preſervation from a totall ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine; which was then deſerved and threatned, making uſe to that end of thoſe very terms the diſcovery was made in, and among others of thoſe now under debate, as moſt argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative in the ſenſe contended for. It is as if he had ſaid, <q>Wilt thou, O Lord, <note place="margin">Numb. 14. 17, 18.</note> bring an utter deſtruction upon this whole people?

<pb n="229" facs="tcp:119239:131"/> poſsibly have drawn ſo ſtrong a plea. For if God <hi>will by no means clear the guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> all Iſrael having at that time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted a deep and deadly guilt, what inference could be made from thence, but that all Iſrael were of neceſsity to periſh?</p>
                  <p>§. 4.

<pb n="230" facs="tcp:119239:132"/> temporal puniſhments in that caſe, cannot but be accounted juſt. The ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther if we take into conſideration that children may be accounted part of the parents themſelves: for as a mans wife is himſelf divided, ſo his children are himſelf multiplied. However they are undoubtedly part of their parents goods, and ſo eſteemed. When God had once ſaid concerning Job, <hi>Behold,</hi>

                  <p>§. 5. As to the latter, Gods viſiting on this wiſe will be found an act of clemency, as well as of equity, if it be conſidered,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That it is but to the third and fourth generation, not to all generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, That all ſorts of ſinners are not ſo puniſhed, but onely or mainly ſuch as are guilty of the moſt hainous provocations; chiefly Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and worſhippers of falſe Gods. For the ſecond commandment (which is the firſt place of Scripture wherein we meet with this expreſsion) hath it thus, <hi>I the Lord thy God am a jealous God,</hi>

                  <pb n="232" facs="tcp:119239:133"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, That it is ſeldome done, but where children tread in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſteps, and are guilty of the ſame ſins with their progenitours.

                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, that it is never done but with mercifull intentions; namely to reſtrain men from ſin upon this ground, becauſe their children, whom they affect ſo dearly are like to ſmart for it. He is a truly miſerable heir that inheriteth his fathers ſins with his lands: the one will quickly eat out all, and more then all the comfort he can expect from the other.

Secondly, Some other things are impoſsible not <hi>to</hi> nature onely, but <hi>in</hi> nature; and that either in reference to the nature of God, when they are ſuch as argue im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection in the doer, as to ſin, and to die: or in reſpect to the nature of the things themſelves, when they are ſuch as implie contradiction, as for a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be made independent.

                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Let the world learn to ſeek after intereſt in him.

Fifthly, <hi>Let ſuch as have received great things from God, maintain a certain greatneſs of ſpirit ſutable to their intereſt in him.</hi> I do not mean an haughty ſpirit, ſwelled with pride, for that is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unſutable to a ſaving intereſt in God, <hi>who beholds the proud afar off;</hi> but <note place="margin">Pſalm 138. 6.</note> an humble ſpirit greatned by continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al converſe with the great God; who by raiſing vp his ſervants hearts to the contemplation and fruition of higher objects, maketh them too big for this world. It is reported of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that <hi>when he was come to years,</hi> or according to the original, <hi>when he was waxed great,</hi>

                  <p>§. 5. Againſt what hath been ſaid in this and the former paragraph there are two principal objections; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of neither is to be waved, leſt it ſhould be thought unanſwerable. The firſt is borrowed from philoſophy, and runs thus. Acts ſuppoſe the being of their objects; The decrees of God are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine acts, and therefore could not paſs upon mens particular perſons before the world was, becauſe there were then none in being. I anſwer that whereas the Acts of God are either <hi>Immanent</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding within, or <hi>Tranſient</hi> paſsing from him, and terminated upon ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what without himſelf; His tranſient Acts do either ſuppoſe, or produce the being of their objects; ſuppoſe it as his Rewarding and Puniſhing, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it, as his creating acts. But thoſe that are immanent (of which rank his Decrees are) do not neceſſarily require the preexiſtence of their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:119239:162"/> 
                     <hi>in eſſe reali</hi> in a way of reality; for it ſufficeth that they have it <hi>in eſſe cognito,</hi> in the forekowledge of God. Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt our Mediatour is ſtyled a <hi>Lambe foreordained before the foundation of</hi>

                     <hi>the world;</hi> yet had he no exiſtence as ſuch till after his incarnation.

So as <hi>Sapores</hi> (which was afterwards the childes name) began his reign before his life.
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:119239:162"/> If ſuch acts when done by men ſeem not irrational, why ſhould any think it ſtrange for the onely-wiſe God to ſet the crown of election upon the head of certain perſons, while as yet they have no being, ſave onely in the womb of his decree?</p>
                  <p>§. 6. The other objection is taken from ſuch places of Scripture as deny God to be an accepter of perſons, which they ſay he muſt needs be, if conſidering mankinde in an equal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition he choſe ſome to life, and paſſed by others.</p>
                  <p>In order to the ſolution hereof, I ſhall firſt <hi>Distinguiſh</hi> between Accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Acception of perſons. We finde them both mentioned by S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

                  <p>A Text which the ſoundeſt divines look at, as a moſt pregnant place to prove a cauſal influence of Divine Predeſtination upon the work of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faith.

                     </gap>, not (as we do) <hi>Ordained,</hi> but <hi>Diſpoſed,</hi> or <hi>well-affected</hi>
                     <pb n="295" facs="tcp:119239:165"/> to eternal life. Unto whoſe corrupt Gloſs, I oppoſe the following conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, If it were to be ſo read, then all that heard the Apoſtles Sermon there recorded, even all and every one without exception ſhould have beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſeeing there is not a man in the world, and therefore none in that congregation who was not diſpoſed, and well-affected to the reward of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life (the will of man being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily carried to the deſire of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs, which none are ſo bruitiſh as not to affect) for that unto which theſe are ſaid to be <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, is not converſion, but life eternal.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Diſpoſedneſs in their ſenſe doth not alwaies precede faith, nor faith alwaies follow it. When <hi>Saul</hi> was in the full career of his perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting madneſs againſt the Saints, what diſpoſedneſs was there in him unto converſion, unleſs fury be a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to faith? yet then did he firſt
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:119239:166"/> believe. In that young man who came to our Saviour, of whom it is teſtified, <hi>That he was not far from the kingdome of God,</hi> which of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions was wanting? yet he went away ſorrowfull, and believed not.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Faith it ſelf is the firſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving diſpoſition that any man hath, becauſe it firſt laies hold upon Chriſt, and of life by him; in ſo much as none is formally diſpoſed to eternal life till he have believed.</p>

His firſt plea is, that 'tis not u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual for all of a city, a congregation that are predeſtinated, to believe at one and the ſame time, therefore that which we aſſert is not like to be the meaning here. For anſwer, I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it is not uſual; no more is it to have three thouſand inhabitants of one city brought in to God on one day. But what if God willing to glorifie his Goſpel, and the power of converting Grace, as he called three thouſand Jews in one day, by <hi>Peters</hi> Miniſtry,

His ſecond Argument runs thus. All that truely believe are not Predeſtinated unto life. Therefore that for which we contend is not to be thought a proper ſenſe. Anſwer. This reaſon is founded upon a grand mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, <hi>viz.</hi> That faith is common to all, whether elect, or non-elect, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>Paul</hi> ſtile it, <hi>the Faith of Gods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,</hi> as before; and Chriſt tels the Jews, <hi>Ye believe not, becauſe ye are not of my ſheep.</hi>

                     </gap>, he muſt not be conceived to have underſtood ſuch as were in that

I ſhall onely here propound, and endeavour to ſatisfie another ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, whereof no mention is there made. <hi>Paul</hi> knew himſelf to be <hi>a choſen veſſel,</hi> for <hi>Ananias</hi> had told him <note place="margin">Acts 9. 15.</note> ſo from Chriſts own mouth: yet ſpeaks of himſelf as of one in ſome danger, at leaſt in ſome poſsibility of becomming a Reprobate, in theſe words, <hi>I keep under my body, and bring it into ſubjection: leſt that by any</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reſp.</hi> To prepare the way for a full anſwer, let it be conſidered, 1. That the places cited in the objection are not fitly oppoſed; becauſe the former is not neceſſarily to be underſtood of election to ſalvation, but may proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be limited to <hi>Pauls</hi> being choſen
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:119239:169"/> an Apoſtle: Neither is the latter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly meant of that reprobation, which is contradiſtinct to the ſaid ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but of ſomewhat elſe. Yea al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be true, and may ſtrongly be inferred from other texts, that <hi>Paul</hi> knew his own election to life eternal, the reprobation ſpoken of in the end of the verſe is not to be taken in the moſt rigid ſenſe, but in a milder. 2. That our Apoſtle, (according to his cuſtome in ſundry epiſtles) was in the end of this chapter fallen upon the uſe of terms agoniſtical, borrowed from the Olympick and other Grecian games in that age; as appeareth in the foregoing verſes. <hi>Know ye not that they</hi>

                     </gap> to the exerciſe of wreſtling, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the antagoniſts mutually ſtrove to caſt each other to the ground, and to keep them under.

If to God the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme judge, then whoſoever carrieth himſelf amiſs in any particular courſe of living, offendeth the Lord, falleth under his fatherly diſpleaſure, and is as to this particular, a perſon diſallowed and rejected, how firm ſoever his ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be as to the main. If to good men, who are ſubordinately to judge of their preachers doctrine and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, a teacher is then ſaid to be unapproved of them, when upon ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of ſome unfaithfulneſs, or looſeneſs in his demeanour, ſome ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality or unlawfull indulgence to his body, they begin to diſeſteem him, in compariſon of what they did before, yea perhaps to caſt him out of their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and of their prayers, of which till then he was a partaker.</p>

                  <p>Theſe things premiſed, let it now be obſerved whether the meaning of the place conteſted about be not clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this, or to this effect. <q>I <hi>Paul</hi> well remembring what I am, a member and miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt, am and ſhall continue carefull to exerciſe my ſelf in all the duties of mortification, not making proviſion for the fleſh to fulfill the luſt thereof: leſt I who by mine office am bound to declare unto others the grand rules of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian practiſe, particularly of tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, which I urged but now, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Every man that ſtriveth for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery is temperate in all things,</hi> ſhould by any ſenſual demeanour of mine own, not onely prove a <hi>caſtaway</hi> as to the eſteem I formerly had in the hearts and conſciences of good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and to the intereſt I enjoyed in their devotion; (which I ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count a loſs far exceeding that of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, or eſtate) but alſo fall under the wrath and fatherly diſpleaſure of

Take onely this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of it; after a brief explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whereof, I intend, if God will, to proceed unto other concernments. Preterition or negative Reprobation is an eternal decree of God purpoſing
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:119239:173"/> within himſelf to deny unto the Non-elect<note place="margin">Exerc. 2.</note> that peculiar love of his, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with election is acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panied, as alſo that ſpecial grace which infallibly bringeth to glory: Of which negations, permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſin, obduration in ſin, and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation for ſin, are direct conſequents. This deſcription carries in the face of it a clear reaſon, why the thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed goeth under the name of Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive reprobation, becauſe it ſtandeth mainly in the denial of thoſe free fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours which it pleaſeth God to beſtow upon his elect. As for the term of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terition, we neither are, nor ought to be aſhamed thereof, however ſome bold writers have jeered it, becauſe it is very ſignificant, and hath been made uſe of by their betters. <hi>Prosper</hi> by name, and that both in verſe and in proſe.

                  <p>§. 2. It is Firſt an eternal decree, coeternal with that of election; for the very chooſing of ſome to ſalvation implieth a paſsing by of ſuch as were not choſen. Let the Reader compare that paſſage in Epheſ. 1. 4. <hi>He hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the eternal purpoſe of God was to deny the Non-elect that pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar love, wherewith his election is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied; in which reſpect he is ſaid to hate them. <hi>Jacob have I loved, but E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau</hi>

We may not beleeve that <hi>Leah</hi> was odious to her husband; yet the text ſaith, <hi>God ſaw that Leah was hated,</hi> which is certainly to be expounded out of the verſe foregoing, where it is ſaid of <hi>Jacob</hi> that he <hi>loved Rachel more</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>§. 3. Fourthly, His purpoſe was to deny unto the <hi>non-elect</hi> that ſpecial grace, which brings infallibly to glory thoſe whom God beſtows it upon. No creature can challenge effectual grace at the hands of God, as a due debt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to his nature, or to his labour. There be many that ſpeak and write of God ſawcily, as if he were bound to give this and that and the other grace, even where they can produce no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe by which he hath made himſelf a debtour.

Sure I am, our Saviour telleth his Diſciples plainly, <hi>It is given to you to know the myſteries of the kingdome of heaven, but to them it is not given,</hi> Matth. 13. 11. And the houſholder in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſtops the mouths of thoſe mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murers that repined, as expecting more from him then it was his pleaſure to give, with the ſole conſideration of its being his will to have it ſo. <hi>Friend, I do thee no wrong.

                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, The conſequents of the forementioned denials, are, 1. Permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſin, particularly of unbelief. <hi>John</hi> 10. 46. <hi>Ye believe not, becauſe ye are

Obduration in ſin. <hi>Romans</hi> 9. 18. <hi>He hath mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will, he hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eneth.</hi> 3. Condemnation for ſin, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel.</hi> 20. 15. <hi>Whoſoever was not found written in the book of life, was caſt into the lake of fire.</hi> This laſt is that which by Divines is uſually ſtyled <hi>Poſitive Reprobation,</hi> and is clearly diſtinguiſhable from the <hi>Negative,</hi> in that the one is an act of punitive juſtice reſpecting ſin commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and continued in. But the other an abſolute decree of Gods moſt free and Sovereign Will, without reſpect to any diſpoſition in the creature. I call them conſequents, not effects; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, though Negative Reprobation be <hi>antecedent</hi> to them all, it is not the proper <hi>cauſe</hi> of them. This difference between the decrees <hi>Aquinas</hi> long ſince took notice of. <q>Election (ſaith he) <note place="margin">Thom. part. 1. quaeſt. 23.

                           <hi rend="sup">um</hi>.</note> is a proper cauſe both of that glory which the Elect look for hereafter, and of that grace, which here they enjoy. Whereas Reprobation is not

                     <hi>An Introduction to</hi> Romans 9. <hi>Moſt part of that chapter expounded, together with ſundry paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in chapter 10, and 11. for proof of theſe two concluſions. 1. That</hi> Paul <hi>in</hi> Rom. 9. <hi>doth upon occaſion propound and proſecute the doctrine of Predeſtination. 2. That he derives the Decree of preterition from the Sovereign greatneſs of God. A Conſectary ſhewing how uſefull the ſaid doctrine is to ſober mindes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. 1. FOr a full proof of our ſecond Aſſertion, <hi>That the greatneſs of God is abundantly manifeſted by his decree of Preterition,</hi> we muſt of neceſsity have recourſe to the ninth chapter of <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> as unto the proper ſeat of that argument; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though divers from abroad, and ſome at home by forreign interpretations, forced Gloſſes and ſtrained Paraphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, have endeavoured to carry the ſenſe quite another way; againſt the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of whoſe endeavours our people may perhaps ſtand in need of an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote.</p>
                  <pb n="328" facs="tcp:119239:182"/>
                  <p>It ſhall be my care, by Divine aſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, (which is alwaies needfull, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in the debating of ſuch my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries) to preſent them with one: and in as calm a way as may be, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out provoking, however without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proching ſuch as are contrary minded, to demonſtrate theſe two Concluſions, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Paul</hi> in the ninth to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> doth upon occaſion propound, and proſecute the doctrine of <hi>Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi> And that he plainly derives the Decree of Preterition from the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign greatneſs of God. But before we enter upon ſo great a depth (which I do with fear and trembling) let it be obſerved that our Apoſtle from the end of the eight, to the beginning of his twelfth chapter, continues a profound complicate diſcourſe wholly about the main concernments of his countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men the <hi>Jews;</hi> and that the beſt help we have for enlightening certain clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in the ninth, ought to be fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="329" facs="tcp:119239:182"/> Chapters: the neglect whereof, I verily think, hath occaſioned the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages of ſo many in their interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of that Scripture. I ſhall hope to improve the Obſervation to good purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>§. 2. Concerning the former of our Concluſions, there will be no need of going far to ſeek the occaſion of <hi>Pauls</hi> falling upon this Doctrine. He had carefully and continually preached faith in Chriſt, as the onely way of ſalvation, in oppoſition to all others. This, however embraced by divers <hi>Gentiles,</hi> could by no means finde en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment with the <hi>Jews.</hi> Be pleaſed to compare Chapter 9. 31, 32, 33. <hi>Iſrael which followed after the Law of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, hath not obtained to the Law of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs. Wherefore? becauſe they ſought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law: for they ſtumbled at that ſtumbling ſtone. As it is written, Behold I lay in S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="330" facs="tcp:119239:183"/> and whoſoever believes on him, ſhall not be aſhamed,</hi> with Chapter tenth, verſe 2, 3, 4. <hi>I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. For they being ignorant of Gods righteouſneſs, and going about to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs, have not ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves to the righteouſneſs of God. For Chriſt is the end of the law for righteouſneſs to every one that believeth.</hi> This their ſtumbling at Chriſt, as they generally did, cauſed a great ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the thoughts of conſidering men, who could not but ſtand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed to ſee, that whereas God had ſet up but one onely way to be laid hold upon, for the attainment of bleſſedneſs, his own onely people in the eye of the world, ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt univerſally decline that, and venture their ſouls upon another. Yet this they did, even they who are here ſo magnificently deſcribed, Chapter 9. verſe 4, 5. <hi>Who were Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites;

<pb n="332" facs="tcp:119239:184"/> of grace weas effectual, and in whom (as few as they were) Gods promiſe to Abraham was preſerved.

According to their double capacity, the anſwer of God to <hi>Rebecca</hi> about them ſeemeth to have had a double aſpect: One to their poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity regarding temporal things eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, of which <hi>Malachy</hi> ſpeaketh, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to their perſons eying chiefly their ſpiritual concernments; and of that <hi>Paul</hi> treats in <hi>Romanes</hi> 9. as the context importeth. Nor can this be wondered at by ſuch as conſider how uſuall it hath been with God, as to diſcover himſelf by degrees (witneſs that in Deuteronomy, <hi>The Lord came from Sinai,</hi>

                  <p>For the firſt, It is the manner of Artificers to deliberate much, and to put themſelves to more then ordinarie pains about their Maſter-pieces. Man was to be the Maſter-piece of this viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble world, and accordingly <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaking of God according to the manner of men, brings him in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting about ſo prime a piece. <hi>God ſaid, Let us make man:</hi> whereas moſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Gen. 1. 26.</note> things were made with a word ſpeaking, <hi>Let there be light, and there was</hi>

And as the Emperour wondred with in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that God, (whoſe beauty and Majeſty is infinite) would be ſerved by ſo deformed a creature, it came to paſs that the Prieſt reading the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>Pſalm,</hi> which was in the courſe of his Liturgy to be rehearſed upon that day, pronounced the ſecond verſe thereof, <hi>Know ye that the Lord he is God, it is he that hath made us and not we our ſelves,</hi> in ſuch a different tone and voice from that which he before uſed,
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:119239:204"/> that the Emperour apprehended it as a thing ordained by Almighty God to meet with and anſwer his preſent co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation, and began to entertain ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent an opinion of the Prieſt, that having informed himſelf after Maſs of his great virtue, he made him Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Colen,</hi> much againſt the good mans will: who notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing behaved himſelf in that great charge with ſingular commendation, and left a moſt ſweet ſavour behinde him.</p>

Now there is a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold ſenſe of this phraſe: for the image of God is taken, firſt, in a large ſenſe, and ſo it is appliable unto all men in regard of the ſubſtance of their ſouls, which are inviſible, incorporeal. and

                     <hi>which are made after the ſimilitude of God.</hi> We read of the Emperour <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> that having exacted a new tribute from the people of <hi>Antioch,</hi> there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe <note place="margin">See Theodor. hiſt. lib. 5. c. 21.</note> a commotion, in which the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple broke down the Statue of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs <hi>Placilla</hi> his late wife. He in a rage ſent his Forces againſt the city to ſack it. One <hi>Macedonius</hi> a Monk inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded thus. If the Emperour be ſo much, and ſo juſtly offended that the image of his wife was ſo defaced, ſhall not the king of heaven (ſaid the Monk) be angry at him if he ſhall deliberately deface and break the image of God in ſo many men as are like to periſh in this Maſſacre. What a vaſt difference is there betwixt reaſonable creatures, and that brazen image? we for that image are eaſily able to ſet up one hundred, but the Emperour with
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:119239:205"/> all his power is not able to reſtore ſo much as an hair of theſe men, if once he kill them. upon which admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> it is ſaid, forbore his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.

In Saints there are the former; they are like to God in their qualities derived from him; but in Chriſt all three.

Thus it fared with <hi>Ezechiah.</hi> After his comming to the Crown for divers years <hi>the Lord was with him, and he proſpered whitherſoever he went forth.</hi> But in the fourteenth year of his reign, the tide of proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty begins to turn. <hi>Sennacharib</hi> comes up againſt him with a moſt formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hoſt, and took his fenced cities. He betakes himſelf to prayer, and the
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:119239:211"/> Lord delivers him by a miracle, ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Angel to deſtroy one hundred eighty five thouſand of his enemies in <note place="margin">Chap. 20. 1. &amp;c</note> a night. But the next news we hear, is that <hi>Ezechiah</hi> was ſick unto death; yet he dies not, but had fifteen years added to his life, and was aſſured by a ſign from heaven of his recovery. Yet preſently after all this he receives a ſad meſſage from thence concerning the loſs of all his treaſure, and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full condition of all his poſterity. See what a ſtrange ſucceſsion is here; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter glorious victories, comes the loſs of his fenced cities, and an alarm given to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> it ſelf. After that a miraculous deliverance, then a mortal ſickneſs, then a cheering ſign, but e're long a Meſſage of very ſad concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

                  <p>§. 4. This God doth for divers good ends and purpoſes. As firſt to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt his wiſdome in compounding paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of Providence, ſo as one ſhall qualifie another: proſperity allay the ſowreneſs of adverſitie; &amp; this aſſwage the ſwellings of that. As the painters skill appears in tempering bright co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and dark ſhadows; the cooks in mingling ſweet &amp; tart ingredients; the muſicians in raiſing harmony out of diſcords; Oratours in making up curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <note place="margin">Librat in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tithetis.</note> ſentences by a fit oppoſition of contrarieties.</p>
                  <p>II. To magnifie his goodneſs. The frame of our ſpirits is ſuch, that if pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitie were continued without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, we ſhould be apt to ſwell and preſume; if adverſitie without intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to ſinck and deſpair. Our weakneſs ſuch, that we ſhould never give a due e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimate to bleſsings, were we not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times taught by experience what it is to
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:119239:212"/> be under preſſures. We learn by ſickneſs to prize health, &amp; by reſtraint to value libertie. A calm is much more pleaſing to us after a tempeſt; and the ſhining forth of the Sun after an elipſe. It is therefore an act of much mercy in God thus to intermingle favours &amp; croſſes, leſt by a conſtant courſe of the former, we ſhould grow wanton and effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, or by continuance of the latter, ſottiſh and ſtupid.</p>
                  <p>III. To keep up and maintain his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect in the world. God will be known to be the Sovereign Lord of all perſons and things; the great diſpoſer of all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in ſuch a way as ſeemeth beſt to himfelf, &amp; therefore gives out bleſſings and croſſes interchangeably, ſo as man ſhall be at no certainty what to expect, but live in a conſtant dependance on him, who keeps the diſpoſal of proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and adverſity in his own hands, to the end that man ſhould finde nothing certain but this, that there is a great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of future events. Wherefore,</p>
                  <pb n="390" facs="tcp:119239:213"/>
                  <p>§. 5. Firſt, take notice from hence what we are to look for in our pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage here. <hi>viz.</hi> viciſsitudes and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges from one condition into another. If <hi>Solomon</hi> had no where ſaid, <hi>There is a time to weep, and a time to laugh,</hi> expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 3. 4.</note> would ſoon have forced us to acknowledge that our whole courſe is chequered with proſperity and adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie; that moſt of a Chriſtians drink in this life is <hi>Oxymel,</hi> moſt of his food, <hi>Bitter-ſweets.</hi> Whileſt <hi>Iſrael</hi> marched throughout the wilderneſs, the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt night <hi>had a pillar of fire,</hi> and bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt day <hi>a pillar of cloud:</hi> ſo in this world, things never go ſo well with the Iſrael of God, but that they groan under ſome affliction; never ſo ill, but that they have ſome comfort afforded them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Learn to maintain in our ſelves a mixture of affections ſuitable to this mixture of Divine diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. <hi>Rejoyce with trembling.</hi> Leaven and Honey were both excluded under the <note place="margin">Pſal. 2. 11. Levit. 2. 11.</note>
                     <pb n="391" facs="tcp:119239:213"/> Law from offering by fire: Leaven for its exceſsive ſoureneſs; Honey for its exceſsive ſweetneſs; <hi>To ſhew</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ainſworth) that in Saints there ſhould nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be extremity of grief, nor of pleaſure, but a mediocrity.</hi> We ſhould be carefull in time of proſperity to fear affliction with a fear of expectation, though not of amazement; with ſuch a fear as may cauſe preparation, but no diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Look at a very fair day, as that which may prove a weather-breeder, and uſher in ſtorms. On the other ſide, in time of adverſity hope for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment. The Pſalmiſt did ſo, <note place="margin">Pſal. 42. 7. 8. <hi>Nemo conſidat nimiùm ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis; Nemo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperet meliora lapſus.</hi> Sen. Trag.</note> 
                     <hi>All thy waves are gone over me, yet the Lord will command his loving-kinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Obſerve the difference that is between this preſent, and that other world. Dying <hi>Aristotle</hi> is reported to have ſaid, <hi>I rejoyce that I am now going out of a world of contraries.</hi> This indeed is ſo. But that which dying men go into is without ſuch mixture. All tears
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:119239:214"/> ſhall be wiped from the Saints eyes; &amp; impenitent ſinners ſhall have judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without mercy. Briefly, in this militant Church, as in the Ark of old, <hi>There is a rod, and a pot of manna</hi> Here up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth we have little Manna with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome rods, little welfare without ſome ſharp affliction; few Rods with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome Manna, not many afflictions without ſome meaſure of conſolation: whereas in <hi>Heaven</hi> there is nothing but Manna, in <hi>Hell</hi> nothing but Rods, or Scorpions rather.</p>
                  <p>§. 6. IV. Keep we our ſelves in a frame of cheerfulneſs, that we may be alwaies prepared in the day of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity to rejoyce. This will appear a duty which we are bound to,</p>

                  <p n="2">II. Becauſe Jeſus Chriſt was <hi>anoynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to give us the oyl of joy for mourning,</hi>

                  <p n="3">III. Becauſe the Spirit of Chriſt is a ſpirit of cheerfulneſs. His two firſt
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:119239:215"/> fruits mentioned <hi>Galat.</hi> 5. 22. are <hi>Love and Joy.</hi> Yea when it is ſaid, <hi>Grieve not</hi>

                     <hi>the holy ſpirit of God,</hi> Heinſius thinketh this to be part of the meaning. Be cheerfull after an holy manner. Let none offend that great gueſt, the ſpirit of God by overmuch ſadneſs.

                  <p n="4">IV. Becauſe our adverſary the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, being a melancholy ſpirit himſelf, delighteth in our ſadneſs. The prince of darkneſs loves to ſee the ſervants of God in a dark condition. He is grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and gets advantage by our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheerfulneſs.

<pb n="395" facs="tcp:119239:215"/> 
                     <hi>ſhould get an advantage of us, for we are not ignorant of his devices.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="5">V. Becauſe if we look to our ſelves, cheerfulneſs is advantageous both to our bodies, therefore compared to the beſt food, ſuch as men uſe to have at feaſts. <hi>He that is of a merry heart hath a</hi>

                     <hi>but a broken ſpirit drieth the bones.</hi> And alſo our ſpirits. Uncheerfulneſs maketh the ſoul of a man drive heavily, as the chariots of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did in the red ſea; but the joy of the Lord oyleth the wheels. Cheerfulneſs ſupples the joynts of our hearts, and ſo rendereth them nimble and active in holy perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances. See <hi>Nehemiah</hi> 8. 10.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI.

                  <p>§. 7. Fifthly, Endure afflictions ſo as in the day of adverſity duly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Nature, Authour and Ends of Croſſes.</p>

                  <p n="3">III. The Ends, Which are ſpecially three. 1. The mortifying of our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions. <hi>By this ſhall the iniquity of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>

                     <pb n="398" facs="tcp:119239:217"/> was to burn off their cords; our luſts are cords, <hi>cords of vanity</hi> in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-phraſe; the fiery tryal is ſent on purpoſe to burn and conſume them. Afflictions help to ſcour off this kinde of ruſt. Adverſity like winter-weather is of uſe to kill the vermine; which the the ſummer of proſperity is wont to breed. 2. For the enlivening and quickning of our graces. <hi>I ſpake unto</hi>

As bruiſing maketh aromatical ſpices to ſend out their ſavour; and colliſion fetcheth fire out of the flint, which was hid before; ſo preſſures excite devotion. The cold water of perſecution is often caſt in the Churches face to fetch her again when ſhe is in a ſwoon. 3. For the
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:119239:217"/> furthering of our glory. Chriſt went from the Croſs to Paradiſe; ſo do Chriſtians. <hi>He was made perfect through</hi>

Unto theſe when I ſhall have added an anſwer to objections, and from each propoſition an inference, the whole will be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely handled.</p>
                  <p>The firſt propoſition, which I am to begin with, is, Divine providence ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it ſelf to all created Beings. Well may we ſtrike in with the Levites in that form of acknowledging God, wherein they went before the people, ſaying, <hi>Thou even thou art Lord alone.</hi>

It is not with God, as with carpenters and ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrights, who make houſes for other men to dwell in, veſſels for others to ſail in, and therefore after they are made look after them no more; God who made all things for himſelf, looks to the preſervation of all.

<pb n="403" facs="tcp:119239:219"/> Sun. So whatever good the creatures have, is by derivation from Jehovah, the fountain of Being. Take away the light of the Sun, the air ceaſeth to ſhine, and ſo it is here. As things Artificial are preſerved in their being by the duration of ſuch natural things as they conſiſt of <hi>v. g.</hi> an houſe by the laſting of ſtones and timber: ſo things natural which depend upon God by the continuance of that Divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence by which they were at firſt made.</p>

A bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate of that Nations ſtory will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently let us underſtand how they were brought into that land, (whereof this place in <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> ſpeaketh) and cared for there by a thouſand pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences. Time was when <hi>Joſeph</hi> was raiſed up to be a nurſing father to them, &amp; that by a moſt remarkable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation. He had been formerly ſold into <hi>Egypt,</hi> was impriſoned without cauſe, caſt as <hi>Junius</hi> thinketh, into that priſon whereunto ſuch were put as had moſt highly offended the king, to be ſure into one <hi>where his feet were burt</hi>

                     <hi>in the ſtocks, and he laid in irons.</hi> Had not his priſon-houſe been ſo bad it is like he ſhould not have had opportunity to make himſelf known to butler and baker of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who were his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-priſoners. The butler being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to his place according to <hi>Joſephs</hi>
                     <pb n="418" facs="tcp:119239:227"/> interpretation of his dream, forgets to acquaint <hi>Pharaoh</hi> with him till all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther means had been uſed to quiet the kings minde, and none found effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al: then he ſpeaketh, and then is <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> ſpeedily advanced. Being ſo he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh a preſerver of the Church in his father, brethren and their families. Afterwards when there was riſen ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther generation that knew not <hi>Joſeph;</hi> and the king of <hi>Egypt</hi> had ſet himſelf by force and art to extinguiſh <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the buſh, although burning was not conſumed in the midſt of the fire: their burdens were increaſed, yet their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons multiplied; and <hi>Moſes</hi> ere-long raiſed up to deliver them out of their bondage. A man preſerved by the daughter of that <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> whom he was called to deſtroy, and by that means brought up at court, yea inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted there both in the Art and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and in all the learning of the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians.</hi> Under his conduct God <hi>did for them</hi> (as one Prophet ſpeaketh) <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:119239:227"/> things which they looked not for.</hi> Puls them out of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> boſome in ſpite <note place="margin">Iſa. 64. 3.</note> of his heart, at their departure ſendeth them laden away with the jewels and treaſures of <hi>Egypt;</hi> maketh a paſſage for them through the ſea, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panieth their hoſts into the wilderneſs. There providence fetcheth them water out of a rock, then which nothing dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and bread from heaven, which is wont to grow out of the earth. There their food is Manna &amp; Quails; a cloud and pillar of fire their guides, when this ſervant of God was dead, up ſteps <hi>Joſhua</hi> in his room, bringeth them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to and ſettleth them in the promiſed land; which proved to them after their ſettlemement by lot, <hi>an habitation of righteouſneſs and mountain of holineſs.</hi> A land flowing not onely with tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, but alſo with ſpiritual milk and honey, after <hi>Solomon</hi> had erected a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnificent Temple for them, which was the wardrobe of thoſe ceremonies wherewith God was then to be ſerved.
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:119239:228"/> Then were they (as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> hath it) <hi>abundantly ſatisfied with the fatneſs of Gods houſe, and made to drink of the river of his pleaſures.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But their ſins having at length caſt them out of that good land, and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned the burning of their Temple, God left them not deſtitute of his help, but ordained for them ſundry refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the time of their captivity. This among others in <hi>Eſthers</hi> time. King <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> under whom they then were in a ſtate of captivity had his ſleep taken from him, would ſpend the time not in this or that exerciſe but in reading; of all books, cals for that of the <hi>Chronicles;</hi> of all places hath that read to him which concerned a good ſervice done by <hi>Mordechai</hi> a Jew; doth not onely take notice of it, but enquire what reward had been given him; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding he had received none cauſeth <hi>Haman</hi> his favourite to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; putteth him upon doing ſingular honour in the view of all men to this

Yea providence went on to work ſo happily in the hearts of thoſe Monarchs, who then held them ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptives, as not long after to proclaim their deliverance, and liberty for them to rebuild both <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</hi> which they alſo attempted.</p>
                  <p>Whileſt the ſecond Temple was building by <hi>Herod,</hi> not ſo magnificent as the former, yet in ſome reſpect more glorious: if <hi>Joſephus</hi> misinform us <note place="margin">

Yea ſo remarkable was the power and greatneſs of God in aſsiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the builders then, that we finde him in <hi>Haggai</hi> and <hi>Zechary,</hi> their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies, which were both written a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:119239:229"/> that time, frequently ſtyled by that name, <hi>The Lord of hosts,</hi> particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly five times in four verſes of Hag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gai. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord of hoſts, yet once</hi>

The ſilver is mine, and the gold is mine, ſaith the Lord of hoſts. The glory of this latter houſe ſhall be greater then of the former, ſaith the Lord of hoſts: and in this place will I give peace, ſaith the Lord of hoſts.</hi> That which raiſed the glory of this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond above that of the firſt Temple was the perſonal preſence of Jeſus Chriſt in it. His coming, preaching, ſuffering, ſo ripened the ſins of this people (who began again to degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate after their return) as hot weather doth the corn, that ere long they and their Temple became a prey to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Eagle.</p>
                  <p>§. 3. III. From the experiments
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:119239:229"/> and acknowledgements of godly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in ſeveral ages. The Bleſſed vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary</hi> after her journey to <hi>Bethle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem,</hi> and lying in of her childe there, may be probably thought to have been ſtraitned in her means, as being but poor, and not to have ſufficient for the maintenance of her childe, her ſelf and Joſeph in the journey they were to take preſently after into <hi>Egypt.</hi> See <note place="margin">Chemnit. harmon.</note> how God provideth; hard before that, he ſendeth the wiſe men from the eaſt, and they bring coſtly preſents with them, gold among others, which was certainly of no ſmall uſe for defraying their enſuing charges. In the year 1573 when the Proteſtants were beſieged in <hi>Rochel</hi> by the French kings forces, God <note place="margin">Collection of French maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacres p. 288.</note> ſent them in daily with the tide an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite number of ſmall fiſhes: ſuch as before that time were never ſeen with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that haven, and preſently upon the end of the ſiege retired again. We reade of <hi>Wolfangus Muſculus,</hi> a late Germane Divine, that having received by <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>

That during his abode there, he ſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced himſelf with this diſtich,

                  <p>There is a three-fold preſervation, which it, and the members of it may look for from Divine Providence. One from, another in, and a third by dangers.

                  <p>§. 1. OUr fourth propoſition is ſtill behinde, viz. Divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is an actour even in ſin it ſelf.

III. That God is an actour in it.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt, This word <hi>Heart</hi> is of various acceptions in the Scripture. Sometime it ſignifieth the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as when it is ſaid, <hi>God gave Solomon</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Kings 4. 29.</note> 
                     <hi>largeneſs of heart, as the ſand.</hi> that is, He
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:119239:237"/> had an underſtanding full of notions,<note place="margin">Exerc. 3.</note> as the ſea-ſhore is full of grains of ſand. Sometimes put for the will, as when <hi>Barnabas</hi> exhorteth the Chriſtians of <hi>Antioch to cleave to the Lord with purpoſe</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Acts 11. 23.</note> 
                     <hi>of heart.</hi> that is, with the full bent and inclination of their wills. For as to know is an act of the underſtanding, ſo to cleave is an act of the will. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for the memory, as when the bleſſed Virgin is ſaid <hi>to have laid up all</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Luke 2. 51.</note> 
                     <hi>our Saviours ſayings in her heart.</hi> that is, kept them under lock and key, like a choice treaſure in her remembrance. Sometimes for conſcience. So the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaketh of a <hi>condemning and not</hi>

                     </gap>, a domeſtical tribunal, or a judge with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in doors. Laſtly, Sometimes for the affections. So the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſaith of people, that when they ſate hearing the word, <hi>their heart went after their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſmeſs.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Ezek. 33. 31.</note> that is, their fears, and hopes,
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:119239:238"/> their deſires, love and other affections were upon ſhops, ſhips, land and other commodities even while they were bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied in the worſhip of God. Each of theſe faculties called Heart in the book of God is liable to its peculiar indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and diſtemper. All put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make up the hard-heartedneſs, of which we are treating; the particular ingredients whereof are theſe that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
                  <p>I. <hi>Unteachableneſs in the underſtanding.</hi> Scripture joyneth <hi>blinding of eyes and hardning of hearts</hi> as near a kin. <hi>He hath</hi>

                     <hi>blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart, that they ſhould not ſee with their eyes, nor underſtand with their heart, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.</hi> It is proverbially ſaid, <hi>Lapidi loqueris;</hi> One had as good ſpeak to a ſtone as to an unteachable man: and we are all ſo by nature.

                     <hi>things of the ſpirit of God, for they are foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſs unto him; neither can he know them becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi> Such
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:119239:238"/> are often preſent at Sermon, ſo are the pillars of ſtone in the Church, and they underſtand both alike.</p>
                  <p>§. 2. II. <hi>Untractableneſs in the will.</hi> There was reaſon enough ſpoken to <hi>Sihon</hi> by <hi>Moſes</hi> his meſſengers; but all would not incline him to yield a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to the army of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in an amica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble way, becauſe he was hardened. <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hon king of Heſhbon,</hi> ſaith Moſes, <hi>would not let us paſs by him, for the Lord thy God</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Deut. 2. v. 27, 28, 30.</note> 
                     <hi>hardened his ſpirit, and made his heart ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate, &amp;c.</hi> So was there enough ſaid and done to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> but ſtill the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of his ſtory is this, <hi>He hardened his heart and would not let Iſrael go.</hi> Steep a ſtone in oyl, it continueth hard ſtill. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had ſundry mercies ſhowen him, being delivered from one plague after another upon <hi>Moſes</hi> his prayers; but the oyl of mercy could not ſoften him. Beat upon a ſtone with an ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, it is a difficult thing, and in ſome caſes impoſsible to make an impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The hammer of Gods word in
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:119239:239"/> the mouth of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> held as it were by the handle of ten notable miracles, gave ten mighty blows at <hi>Pharaohs</hi> will; yet could make ſo little impreſsion, that after the ten plagues his heart was ten times harder then before.</p>
                  <p>III. <hi>Unfaithfulneſs in the memory.</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent hereunto is that upbraiding paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of our Saviour to his Diſciples, <hi>Have ye your heart yet hardened? do ye not</hi>

                     <hi>remember?</hi> they ſeemed to have at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent forgotten two of Chriſts miracles, and are therefore charged with hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartedneſs. Let water fall upon fleſh it moiſteneth it, upon earth it ſoaketh in and rendereth it fruitfull: let it fall upon a rock it runneth preſently off and leaveth no footſteps behinde it. Where hardneſs of heart prevaileth (as <note place="margin">Verſ. 19, 20.</note> here it did not, and therefore the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples a little awakened by Chriſts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogations were able to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his miracles) there is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly no more of a chapter, ſermon
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:119239:239"/> or pious diſcourſe remaining in the hearers memory, then there is moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture upon a rock after a good ſhowre of rain.</p>
                  <p>IV. <hi>Unſenſibleneſs in the conſcience.</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of ſome <hi>paſt feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>

Smite a ſtone as long as you will, beat it while you can ſtand over it, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth not; lay a mountain upon it it groaneth not. Such are ſome mens conſciences. Let God beat upon them with ſermon after ſermon, croſs after croſs; let them have worlds of oaths, lies, cheats, &amp; other ſins to anſwer for, they feel not the load of theſe moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, complain not of them, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps with <hi>Judas</hi> go out from the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to play the traytour, and with king <hi>Ahaz</hi> ſin yet more in their diſtreſs. Although temperance, modeſty, and the like diſpoſitions be in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure quite extinguiſhed, yet if conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:119239:240"/> like <hi>Jobs</hi> meſſenger be ſtill left to report the ſtory of this deſolation, there is ſome hope; but if, as <hi>David</hi> ſometime dealt with the Philiſtines, all be ſlain, and none left alive to bring the tidings, if not onely al ingenuity be baniſhed, but the very mouth of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience alſo ſtopt, the caſe is deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</p>
                  <p>V. <hi>Unmoveableneſs in the affections.</hi> See an inſtance thereof in king <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> of whom it is ſaid, <hi>He did that which was</hi>

And he alſo rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him ſwear by God: but he ſtiffened his neck and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened his heart from turning unto the Lord God of Iſrael.</hi> Zedekiah's heart was ſo obdurate, as not to have his affections <note place="margin">

<pb n="471" facs="tcp:119239:253"/> ſaid, My Lord, I have obſerved much perplexity, and thereupon much reſtleſneſs in you.

I pray you therefore be not troubled at any thing, but refer the iſſue to God. Whereupon he is ſaid to have fallen to reſt.</q> Our way to be quiet is to do the like upon all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; to drive up things to divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and there to reſt. Time was when <hi>Daniels</hi> head and heart was fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the viſions of God; by which the great changes that were to happen in the government of the world had been newly made known to him: viz. the wheeling about of Monarchy from the <hi>Babylonians</hi> (who then were in the higheſt of their power) to the <hi>Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> thence to the <hi>Grecians,</hi> and thence to the <hi>Romanes;</hi> from an head of gold, to a breaſt and arms of ſilver, from
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:119239:254"/> them to a belly and thighs of braſs, and from them to legs of iron, and to feet part of iron, part of clay; yea in the end to a little ſtone cut out without hands, which brake the whole image in pieces.

                  <p>§. 4. An objection againſt the third propoſition, concerning Gods ſpecial care and providence over the Church, and the members thereof, may be formed thus. The Church of all Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties, the Saints of all men, are the moſt in ſufferings. Yea ſome Churches, by name thoſe ſeven in <hi>Aſia,</hi> which vve reade of in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> have been extinguiſhed.

That every veſſel of mercy muſt expect ſcouring in order to brightneſs; and hovvever trees in the vvilderneſs grovv vvithout culture, trees in the orchard muſt be pruned in order to fruitfulneſs, and corn-bearing fields broken up, vvhen barren heaths are left untouched; yea that in ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular inſtances the candleſtick hath been removed and the place unchurch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet the inference is not ſolid, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe firſt, All afflictions are advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious to the godly.

<pb n="475" facs="tcp:119239:255"/> preſervation (ſuch as I inſiſted upon above in the ſecond Exercitation of this Aphoriſme) are for the moſt part miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtood, and conſequently miſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved. Learn vve for the future to embrace them vvith theſe three cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>§. 5. I. That they do in eſpecial manner concern the Church Catholick, not this or that particular Nation or Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If that in the beginning of Eſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the tvventy ſeventh vvere to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as a National Church, vve all knovv it hath been ruined long ſince notvvithſtanding the promiſe there made, vvhich muſt therefore be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of it as a type of the Church uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal; that is ſo vvatered and kept as to be inexpugnable. Look as by vertue of the Covenant made vvith <hi>Noah</hi> that the vvhole earth ſhould never be again overflovvn vvith a general deluge, vve may be ſure it never ſhall: yet there have ſince, and may ſtill be divers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undations, whereby ſome parts of the
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:119239:256"/> earth have been, and may be laid waſte: ſo by virtue of Gods promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, we may be confident that the gates of hell ſhall never prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the whole Church of Chriſt; yet may divers particular Churches be ruined (as thoſe in <hi>Aſia</hi> have been). No man knows how many more may have the ſame line of Deſolation drawn over them. Mean while the Catholick Church, ſtill, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly continues, but thrives, becauſe like the ſea, it wins in one place, what it loſeth in another; like the Sun, it riſeth to the Antipodes, when it ſets to our Hemiſphere.</p>
                  <p>II. That a particular Church in caſe it degenerate, cannot challenge ſuch intereſt in them, as it might, if it had continued pure. There was to be a time when the vineyard in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaias</hi> ſhould affoard red wine; then it <note place="margin">Iſa. 5. 4, 5, 6.</note> might look for watering every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and being kept from all hurt. But there was alſo a-time when it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated,
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:119239:256"/> and inſtead of red wine, brought forth wilde grapes; when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of keeping it, the Lord threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to take away the hedge, and pull down the wall thereof: inſtead of preſerving it from hurt, to let it be eaten up, broken down, and laid waſte; inſtead of watering, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the clouds that they rain not upon it. Who knoweth but the Lord hath ſaid of us in this Nation, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the old <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church? <hi>Their vine is of the vine of Sodome, and of the fields</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Deut. 32. 32, 33, 34.</note> 
                     <hi>of Gomorrah: their grapes are grapes of gall, their cluſters are bitter. Their wine is the poyſon of dragons, and the cruel ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome of aſps.</hi> Sure I am, he hath alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy begun to cut our Vine till it bleed; and if repentance ſtep not in to turn away wrath, may be provoked to ſay of England as he once did of <hi>Paleſtina. I had planted thee a noble vine, holy, a right ſeed: How then art thou turned into a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate</hi>

                  <p>III. That they uſe not to be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled all at once, but by certain peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ods, ſo as to have their gradual ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments. I ſhall inſtance in that of <hi>Eſaias</hi> formerly mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Piſcator</hi> and <hi>Scultetus</hi> upon the place interpret it of that preſervation which God vouchſafed the Jewiſh Church under <hi>Ezra, Zerubbabel,</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> in a ſtate of peace and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, notwithſtanding the oppoſition made againſt it. Others expect a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther accompliſhment thereof, when the Jews ſhall be called in a glorious manner, and <hi>when the deliverer ſhall come out of Sion, and turn away ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>

Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he is.</p>
                  <p>§. 7. The better to help us in the performance of ſo important a duty as this, take along with us the following directions.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. Get and keep aſſurance of a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar intereſt in the love and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God in Chriſt. We neither truſt known enemies nor doubtfull friends with what we account preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. They that know God to be their enemy, they that doubt whether he be their friend or no, cannot with confidence caſt their whole care upon him. But he that can groundedly
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:119239:260"/> ſay with <hi>David, I am thine,</hi> may go on as he doth, <hi>Lord, ſave me.</hi> He that <note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 94.</note> can ſay with aſſurance of faith, <hi>The Lord is my ſhephard,</hi> may confidently <note place="margin">Pſal. 23. 1.</note> add, <hi>I ſhall not want.</hi> The ſpouſe may go <hi>leaning upon her beloved</hi> with all her <note place="margin">Cant. 6. 3. 7. 10. 8. 5.</note> weight, when ſhe hath firſt been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to ſay, <hi>My beloved is mine, and I am his.</hi> I am my beloveds, and his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire <hi>is towards me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">II. Continue in well-doing. Let them that ſuffer according to the will of God (ſaith S. <hi>Peter</hi>) commit the keeping of their ſouls to him in well-doing, as unto a faithfull Creatour. Look how much care a man hath to pleaſe God, ſo much confidence may he have to caſt all his care upon him. Whileſt the people of Iſrael went up to the place of Gods publick worſhip, all the males that were of age, thrice in a year, leaving none but women and children at home, ſo giving the enemy fair oportunity for invaſion: God undertakes they ſhall not ſo much
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:119239:260"/> as deſire or think of ſuch a thing. <hi>Neither ſhall any man deſire thy land, when thou ſhalt go up to appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>

                     <hi>the Lord thy God, thrice in the year.</hi>

                  <p n="3">III. Treaſure up the promiſes, chiefly ſuch as are made on purpoſe to aſſure us of Gods caring for us: that in particular, <hi>Let your converſation be without covetouſneſs, and be content with</hi>
